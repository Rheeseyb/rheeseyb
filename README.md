### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You might remember me from such products as:
- [Utopia](https://utopia.app), the design and coding environment for React that runs in the browser ([repo](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia))
- [World of Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warriors), a smash hit mobile game that was featured in the App Store for over a month and handled millions of users in the first week without breaking a sweat
- [Moshi Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshi_Monsters), a highly successful [BAFTA winning](https://twitter.com/RheeseyB/status/1194923628552474625) Flash game
- ...and some other startups and finance stuff before that

### Anyway

Since you're here, check out the main thing I'm working on https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia. We're really looking to push the boundaries of what the browser and React are capable of so that we can remove the chasm separating design and development. If that excites you, and is something you too want to be working on, let me know because I'd love a chat ðŸ™‚
